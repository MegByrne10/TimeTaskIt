TimeTaskIt is a To Do list application that allows the user to make lists containing tasks that they assign due dates to.  When the user signs in they can see an index of their lists and tasks with upcomming deadlines from all of those lists. Users are able to keep the app from getting too cluttered with uncompleted and forgotten tasks by a rake task that automatically deletes expiered tasks.
